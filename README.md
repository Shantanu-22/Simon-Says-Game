# Simon-Says-Game
I've crafted a Simon Says game in JavaScript, where players repeat computer-generated button sequences. Success propels them to higher levels, while mistakes conclude the game, showcasing their score. Players initiate or restart the game with a keypress. The implementation features engaging button flashes and a scoring system, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
